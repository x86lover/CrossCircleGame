# CrossCircleGame
A Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in C++

Pretty standard game, needs a bugfix for the same repeated moves, but it's functional.


I'm temporarily using the std namespace, next release it won't be included. I'm also looking forward to make a moves record, to show at the end of the game.
